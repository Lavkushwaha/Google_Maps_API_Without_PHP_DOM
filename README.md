# Google_Maps_API_Without_PHP_DOM

Google Maps v3 API documentation was based on PHP DOM which was removed officiallly from next version of PHP 5.x.x hence it was difficult to 
intrigate maps API with websites and apps.
Now its resolved now so read my changes in codes and intrigate in whatever you want to.
 


STEPS:
1:Create Database 
2:update Cofig.php file 
3:import mysql.sql file
4:run the map.html

soon working on module for php intrigation direcly ........wait
